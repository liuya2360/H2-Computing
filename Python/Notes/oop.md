#OOP  
* `class <name of class> (<parent class>)`
* `__init__` -> called when a new instance is created   
* `self` -> refer to the current instance (the role is called on/for)
* `__str__` -> str(x)

## Questions:
* Difference between object and instances?  
Ans:  
class -> template (methods, attributes)  
instance  (of a class) -> 1 case/example of the class in use
